regimes. While some several cases adopted hybrid forms of government, some others have achieved democratic
consolidation. On the other hand, we currently observe that many established democracies experience declines in
freedom, while emboldened autocracies step up their repression at home. This course gives a broad overview of
the literature explaining these different patterns of democratization and reversals from a comparative perspective.
Based on observational data, the course uncovers all different approaches on the causal inferences of democratic
transitions, democratic consolidation and democratic declines such as the structural, international, cultural,
institutional and rational-choice explanations.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Differentiate and give examples for the varying meanings of the concepts such as a “democratic transition,” “democratic consolidation,” “democratic decline” and “democratic breakdown” across space and time;</li><li>Analyze the constitutive and causal factors for democratization and democratic declines in different contexts;</li><li>Bring together the theories of transition, consolidation, regression or breakdown of democracy with empirical observations from different case;</li><li>Develop and defend original arguments in the study of democratization in class discussions and the final research papers;</li><li>Write a research paper with academic quality assessing the explanatory power of the theories of democratization.</li></ul>","IRS390","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

chronologically, the course builds an overall view of auteur theory across cultures, considering film criticism, as
well as analyzing the styles of major auteurs. Students will also become familiar with key concepts in film studies
including realism, expressionism, montage, mise en scene, and genre. As students acquire a better familiarity with

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000002LLKAY","[LearningCourse]","World History I","This course is primarily an overview of Ancient Civilizations from approximately 3500 BC to AD 1500. It includes
the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Students will first discuss Havel’s involvement in the theatre On the Balustrade in the 1960s. His early absurdist plays will be viewed also in association with the work of prominent European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, whose work Havel helped to introduce in Czechoslovakia, and Tom Stoppard, who has acknowledged a debt to Havel’s drama. The course will move to outline Havel’s involvement as a dissident after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, and follow his removal from the public sphere by the totalitarian regime. Havel’s work as a political dissident will be traced through the reading of selected essays and petitions, including his letter to President Husák and the Charter 77 declaration. The latter will be read in its broader context of the coming together of various strands of political dissent (from opposition intellectuals through ex-communist politicians to the Czech underground movement) due to the persecution of the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Finally, Havel’s official career as a politician will be outlined, from his role as a founding member of the Civic Forum in 1989, through two terms in office as President, up to his retirement from top politics and return to creative writing, as exemplified by his last play Leaving and his subsequent film version of the same. Throughout, Havel’s career will be viewed on the backdrop of life in Czechoslovakia, through the mild thaw of the 60s, a return to totalitarianism in the 70s and 80s, up to the liberal atmosphere of the Velvet Revolution, with the objective to facilitate a better understanding of everyday life in these various periods. Finally, students will have a chance to discuss a recent (2020) biographical film about Havel, considering how it conceptualises Havel’s importance and legacy. The course will be complemented by screenings of plentiful documentary material (and, if possible, the physical presentation of a variety of printed and other materials and artifacts).

foregrounding the importance of narrative voice, point of view, and plot structure. The sessions dedicated to poetry
involve the basics of poetics, analyzing the use of form and figurative language in the creation of meaning. Finally,

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000389KAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Throughout the last decades, the growing significance of religion and ethnicity in politics is part of a larger
phenomenon often dubbed as the rise of identity politics. But what is the true nature of identity-driven politics
with regard to religion and ethnicity? Are ages-old atavistic conflicts resurfacing after being suppressed by the
modern state and the ideals of enlightenment? Or are these identities simply instrumental tools exploited by
populist politicians at a time when democratic and mass-based politics have become the main norm? And from a
normative and practical point of view, how can and how should a state manage religious and ethnic differences?
Under what conditions do these differences turn into political conflicts? When and why do these conflicts end up
with violence in some settings, whereas in others they are resolved non-violently? This course aims to provide the
students some analytical tools to find their own answers to such questions and understand the ways religion and
ethnicity interact with politics. Drawing upon multiple theoretical and disciplinary approaches, this course explores

integration, identity politics and gender, bioethics, faith, and religious symbols, borders, and state sovereignty
became new key political cleavages - and why now? Not only are these issues powerful enough to decide elections,
shape prospects of liberal democracy, as well as international affairs incl. European integration and the relations
between the West and „the Rest“. They have been even tearing apart family members, long-life friends and local
communities. Why the Western societies increasingly fail to agree on basic common principles and even on
essential facts? What causes the polarization, atomization and even radicalization? Has it been mainly the digital
revolution, advanced dissinformation/manipulation campaigns and the psychological mechanisms of vitual
communication? Are there real new threats and insecurities on the rise? Is then ´political correctness´ or rather the

literature, and even popular art form such as comics. We shall study the texts by philosophers working within a
particular tradition, the so-called analytic tradition. This is now a dominant methodology within philosophy,

anti-Semitism is not merely a product of centuries of anti-Jewish prejudice; rather, racial anti-Semitism must be
understood as something which evolved in close symbiosis with racial prejudices directed against Africans – slave

course also serves as an testing “laboratory” for students to see “how it’s done,” how does theory connect to reality,
before they attempt to do it themselves in their own Theses.
Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical
thinking. Research studies on world wars, terrorism, international norms and institutions, women or media political
communication will be the proverbial bread and butter of this course as they best illustrate the application of
theories in particular situations/cases; the goal is to help students understand the logic, structure and process “how
to” get from theoretical assumptions to real-life situation application and results.

Throughout the last decades, the growing significance of religion and ethnicity in politics is part of a larger
phenomenon often dubbed as the rise of identity politics. But what is the true nature of identity-driven politics
with regard to religion and ethnicity? Are ages-old atavistic conflicts resurfacing after being suppressed by the
modern state and the ideals of enlightenment? Or are these identities simply instrumental tools exploited by
populist politicians at a time when democratic and mass-based politics have become the main norm? And from a
normative and practical point of view, how can and how should a state manage religious and ethnic differences?
Under what conditions do these differences turn into political conflicts? When and why do these conflicts end up
with violence in some settings, whereas in others they are resolved non-violently? This course aims to provide the
students some analytical tools to find their own answers to such questions and understand the ways religion and
ethnicity interact with politics. Drawing upon multiple theoretical and disciplinary approaches, this course explores

Revolution in 1989, as Czechoslovakia’s first post-communist president, and prior to this a leading political
dissident and avant-garde playwright. Students will first discuss Havel’s involvement in the theatre On the
Balustrade in the 1960s. His early absurdist plays will be viewed also in association with the work of prominent
European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, whose work Havel helped to introduce in Czechoslovakia, and
Tom Stoppard, who has acknowledged a debt to Havel’s drama. The course will move to outline Havel’s
involvement as a dissident after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, and follow his removal
from the public sphere by the totalitarian regime. Havel’s work as a political dissident will be traced through the
reading of selected essays and petitions, including his letter to President Husák and the Charter 77 declaration. The
latter will be read in its broader context of the coming together of various strands of political dissent (from
opposition intellectuals through ex-communist politicians to the Czech underground movement) due to the
persecution of the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Finally, Havel’s official career as a politician will
be outlined, from his role as a founding member of the Civic Forum in 1989, through two terms in office as
President, up to his retirement from top politics and return to creative writing, as exemplified by his last play
Leaving and his subsequent film version of the same. Throughout, Havel’s career will be viewed on the backdrop
of life in Czechoslovakia, through the mild thaw of the 60s, a return to totalitarianism in the 70s and 80s, up to the
liberal atmosphere of the Velvet Revolution, with the objective to facilitate a better understanding of everyday life
in these various periods. Finally, students will have a chance to discuss a recent (2020) biographical film about
Havel, considering how it conceptualises Havel’s importance and legacy. The course will be complemented by

Nazism and Liberal democracy (including anti-totalitarian activism) will be reviewed using a range of cultural
sources. Areas which touch on current tensions between Liberal democracy and illiberalism /authoritarianism will
be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000003y5KAA","[LearningCourse]","World History I","This course is primarily an overview of Ancient Civilizations from approximately 3500 BC to AD 1500. It includes
the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Students will first discuss Havel’s involvement in the theatre On the Balustrade in the 1960s. His early absurdist plays will be viewed also in association with the work of prominent European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, whose work Havel helped to introduce in Czechoslovakia, and Tom Stoppard, who has acknowledged a debt to Havel’s drama. The course will move to outline Havel’s involvement as a dissident after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, and follow his removal from the public sphere by the totalitarian regime. Havel’s work as a political dissident will be traced through the reading of selected essays and petitions, including his letter to President Husák and the Charter 77 declaration. The latter will be read in its broader context of the coming together of various strands of political dissent (from opposition intellectuals through ex-communist politicians to the Czech underground movement) due to the persecution of the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Finally, Havel’s official career as a politician will be outlined, from his role as a founding member of the Civic Forum in 1989, through two terms in office as President, up to his retirement from top politics and return to creative writing, as exemplified by his last play Leaving and his subsequent film version of the same. Throughout, Havel’s career will be viewed on the backdrop of life in Czechoslovakia, through the mild thaw of the 60s, a return to totalitarianism in the 70s and 80s, up to the liberal atmosphere of the Velvet Revolution, with the objective to facilitate a better understanding of everyday life in these various periods. Finally, students will have a chance to discuss a recent (2020) biographical film about Havel, considering how it conceptualises Havel’s importance and legacy.

relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will

Relations Research Methods courses by connecting theory with empirical reality through practical cases; the
course also serves as an testing “laboratory” for students to see “how it’s done,” how does theory connect to reality,
before they attempt to do it themselves in their own Theses.
Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical
thinking. Research studies on world wars, terrorism, international norms and institutions, women or media political
communication will be the proverbial bread and butter of this course as they best illustrate the application of
theories in particular situations/cases; the goal is to help students understand the logic, structure and process “how
to” get from theoretical assumptions to real-life situation application and results.

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

a major research project in the social sciences. In the spirit of interdisciplinarity, its aim is to enable learners to
develop an understanding of the basic methodological choices available in the field of political science and in
cognate fields such as International Relations, Law, and sociology. Problems of methodology and research design
will be approached in the broader context of the philosophy of social science. Throughout the course students will
have the opportunity to engage a series of debates concerning the core methodological and philosophical traditions
in the social sciences such as positivism, hermeneutics, Marxism, poststructuralism, and formal theory. These
include perspectives which seek to understand human action from ‘the inside’, by paying attention to its subjective
or intersubjective meaning, as well as rival, scientific perspectives of studying the social world which assume the
human subject away. An alternative set of theories present the entire social reality as a ‘text’, whereas rival formal
theories discard the idea of meaning, language and reflexivity. Additionally, students will acquire competences in
research design with a particular emphasis on qualitative research (ethnography, participant observation, case
studies). The aim is to enable each researcher to develop an independent research project by identifying a
methodological tradition of choice and by acquiring basic knowledge of its fundamental principles, as an

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000004jPKAQ","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

attention to the original, indispensable link between populism and democracy. The starting point of our exploration
will be the Greek form of democracy and its contemporary critique, which includes Plato&#39;s diagnosis of those who
wished to win the admiration and love of &quot;the people&quot;. Using various texts, we will strive to define not only the
term “demos” but also “demagogues”. Then, we will move on to the important shifts that took place during the
Roman period, especially in the waning days of the Roman Republic, when the influence of elected politicians
started to increase. We will find out who, according to Cicero and other writers, were populares and optimates and
whether populares were the precursors of modern populists. This particular question, along with more general
discussions of the importance of personal charisma in the history of populism, will allow us to draw connections
with the scholarship on contemporary populism. In this context, we will also consider the difference between
ideological populism and populism without ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Summarize and analyze the arguments presented by philosophers on populism throughout history;</li><li>Comprehend and critically discuss the nature of ancient, medieval and modern concepts of populism;</li><li>Conduct basic academic research and analytical writing appropriate to the undergraduate level;</li><li>Communicate with improved analytical, argumentative, and writing skills;</li><li>Apply knowledge and critical thinking and theoretical insights to contemporary issues.</li></ul>","PHI405","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000004jeKAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and effective policy making. By studying the psychological processes
underlying cooperation we gain knowledge that can help us create environments and institutions which will be
more successful in tackling the societal challenges. The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the
psychological processes of human cooperation. This course draws on theories and empirical findings from social,
cognitive and developmental psychology, and behavioural economics.
The course will address questions such as:
What are the evolutionary roots of human cooperation?
How does prosocial behavior develop in children?
What are the major strengths and weaknesses of human cooperation?
Which factor supports inter- and intra-group cooperation?
What is the role of communication in cooperative behaviors?
How can our knowledge about game theory models improve decisions in public policy?
The course consists of three main sections.
Section 1 will explore the origins of human cooperation. It will introduce the basic evolutionary mechanisms (such
as direct reciprocity, reputation, punishment etc.) and psychological mechanisms from a developmental and
comparative perspective.
Section 2 will address psychological mechanisms of cooperation such as attention sharing, knowledge sharing and
perspective taking. Both positive and negative motivational forces beyond cooperative behaviours will be
discussed.
Section 3 will address challenges to cooperation, including cheating and exploitation. It will provide a brief
introduction to game theory and will introduce the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as
equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. Students will learn about strategies in games by actually playing and
making decisions in various games. Additionally, Section 3 will demonstrate how some of the present challenges

all mean? We need to understand that, because popular culture and media influence us all. This course will
introduce you to scholars who have thought about these issues, and to their very different answers about what the
popular culture and media are, and how best to understand them.
We humans enjoy making meanings and sharing them with others. And these meanings have a lot of power to
influence us, sometimes in ways we don’t even notice. What is the best way to understand popular culture and the
media? This course will introduce you to several thinkers – some philosophers, some psychologists (at least one),
some anthropologists, and others – who have thought long and hard about the media and popular culture. They
have different answers about what is culture and media, how do they make meaning, what is the best ways to
interpret their messages? And what do these theories tell us about what it means to be human, what is really real?
If these kinds of questions interest you, and you would like know more about the media and popular culture and

of the artist as well as the gender of the model.
Because painting, and especially from the model, requires a long period of concentrated time, this studio course

starting to paint. There will be an hour lunch break (12:30 – 13:30) and we will conclude at 16:00.
This is the common structure for most art academy classes as opposed to the typical university lecture courses.

to two lessons.

Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical
thinking. Research studies on world wars, terrorism, international norms and institutions, women or media political
communication will be the proverbial bread and butter of this course as they best illustrate the application of
theories in particular situations/cases; the goal is to help students understand the logic, structure and process “how
to” get from theoretical assumptions to real-life situation application and results.
Besides supporting the theory-method “backbone” of the International Relations study programme (a string of
prerequisites: 1. Introduction to International Relations 2. International Relations Research Methods 3. Thesis
Seminar 4. Thesis), this course seeks to address older but especially currently discussed topics in the field of
International Relations, foreign policy, security or other interdisciplinary topics. Since this course is intended as
an advanced IR course – seminar format is the preferred choice with the bulk of work focused on cases (analysed
from particular theoretical perspectives), to demonstrate to students their logic and argumentation, work with data,
operationalization of theoretical concepts etc.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Pick an appropriate theory for the problem at hand;</li><li>Weigh pros and cons of particular perspective in case studies;</li><li>Understand the structure of research papers and case studies (be able to identify its sections such as literature review, problem justification, theoretical perspective, identify concepts used, identify their “translation” in the given case);</li><li>Start creating their own research designs – monkey see monkey do.</li></ul>","IRS270","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Throughout the last decades, the growing significance of religion and ethnicity in politics is part of a larger
phenomenon often dubbed as the rise of identity politics. But what is the true nature of identity-driven politics
with regard to religion and ethnicity? Are ages-old atavistic conflicts resurfacing after being suppressed by the
modern state and the ideals of enlightenment? Or are these identities simply instrumental tools exploited by
populist politicians at a time when democratic and mass-based politics have become the main norm? And from a
normative and practical point of view, how can and how should a state manage religious and ethnic differences?
Under what conditions do these differences turn into political conflicts? When and why do these conflicts end up
with violence in some settings, whereas in others they are resolved non-violently? This course aims to provide the
students some analytical tools to find their own answers to such questions and understand the ways religion and
ethnicity interact with politics. Drawing upon multiple theoretical and disciplinary approaches, this course explores
the related concepts of religion and ethnicity in political science from a comparative perspective using case studies
drawn across different time periods and contexts around the world.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Define and describe basic approaches to the study of ethnicity and religion;</li><li>Understand the modern notion of nation state and how such a state interacts with religion and ethnicity;</li><li>Develop a historical and theoretical framework for understanding the roots of religious and ethnic conflicts and alternative paradigms developed for the solution of these conflicts;</li><li>Explain how and why policies related to ethnic and religious identity vary across similar and different regime types;</li><li>Explain and analyze the fluid character of the production of religion and ethnicity;</li><li>Critically reflect on whether modernization theories explain the contemporary surge of ethnicity and religion.</li></ul>","IRS532","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Therefore, we will not only speak about critical art theory but exercise it through reading, interpreting, discussing and confronting its traditional sources and artistic instances such as contemporary ramification including pop culture. Thus, the seminar should not be informative, but transformative. Instead of simple lecturing or conveying information, we will engage in common critical practice or poetic of knowledge if you will.
Each session should work on its own, providing examples or even controversies for interpretation and debate. The program of the seminar falls roughly into 2 parts. Firstly (in sessions 1-7), we will cover historical conditions of critical art theory, so that we can move onto the second part (8-15), where we will focus on particular and current issues concerned with application rather than genealogy of critical theory. The program of the seminar should nonetheless reflect the interest of students.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Critically assess art, pop culture and cultural artifacts or narratives;</li><li>Have an insight into modern and contemporary art in terms of its critical import;</li><li>Have a systematic overview of critical (art) theory;</li><li>Apply critical and academic standards in writing.</li></ul>","ART573","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2023/24 Spring Term"

Students will first discuss Havel’s involvement in the theatre On the Balustrade in the 1960s. His early absurdist plays will be viewed also in association with the work of prominent European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, whose work Havel helped to introduce in Czechoslovakia, and Tom Stoppard, who has acknowledged a debt to Havel’s drama. The course will move to outline Havel’s involvement as a dissident after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, and follow his removal from the public sphere by the totalitarian regime. Havel’s work as a political dissident will be traced through the reading of selected essays and petitions, including his letter to President Husák and the Charter 77 declaration. The latter will be read in its broader context of the coming together of various strands of political dissent (from opposition intellectuals through ex-communist politicians to the Czech underground movement) due to the persecution of the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Finally, Havel’s official career as a politician will be outlined, from his role as a founding member of the Civic Forum in 1989, through two terms in office as President, up to his retirement from top politics and return to creative writing, as exemplified by his last play Leaving and his subsequent film version of the same. Throughout, Havel’s career will be viewed on the backdrop of life in Czechoslovakia, through the mild thaw of the 60s, a return to totalitarianism in the 70s and 80s, up to the liberal atmosphere of the Velvet Revolution, with the objective to facilitate a better understanding of everyday life in these various periods. Finally, students will have a chance to discuss a recent (2020) biographical film about Havel, considering how it conceptualises Havel’s importance and legacy. The course will be complemented by screenings of plentiful documentary material (and, if possible, the physical presentation of a variety of printed and other materials and artifacts).

for a democratic nation in the world. But does that guarantee mean you can say or write anything? And if not, why
not? The simple answer is that it wouldn’t be ethical, and has potential for negative consequences. Ethics are not
unique to media. They’re taught in almost every profession, even in nearly every “democratic” country. But
nowhere are they more important than in journalism. And at no time are they more important than now. The market
economy, the pressure by those in power, business interests and digital technology all challenge media ethics.
Media ethics are not limited to political news. Ethics play crucial role in advertising and public relations as well.
Misleading in marketing and communication also can have terrible consequences. Digital technology and social
media introduce new challenges in media, marketing and communication. Today, videos have more influence than
text and, therefore, this course will address media ethics in video production as well. Pseudo-news outlets and bots
spread harmful misinformation repeatedly shared on Facebook and other social media. They confuse the audience
and help in creating a “post-truth” society. In such environments, the media outlets have been struggling to
maintain ethics in journalism, making compromises for the sake of profit, interest or politics. The course will

have been addressed through a range of cultural mediums. Specifically, the impact and reception of Communism,
Nazism and Liberal democracy (including anti-totalitarian activism) will be reviewed using a range of cultural
sources. Areas which touch on current tensions between Liberal democracy and illiberalism /authoritarianism will
be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.
In this course we will be mixing approaches to how we explore the issues. Prague is one of the few capitals that
experienced Liberal democracy, Nazism, Communism, and a return to Liberal democracy in little more than 50
years. Therefore, many opportunities emerge to meet people and visit places and events which can increase our

Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical

Yet few universities explicitly teach the leadership as a relational process that can be learned and put into practice. And professions across the globe suffer from a lack of courageous leadership. In this course, we start with the assumption that leadership can be learned and that one of the best ways to learn it is from examining the lives of ordinary people who were able to accomplish the extraordinary. Through the lens of contemporary leadership research, we draw lessons, strategies, and inspiration for becoming leaders in our own domain and context.
One of the most universal cravings of the human spirit is for leadership that is grounded in character, one that reaches beyond success to significance. Many say that our times are defined by a leadership crisis, a void of courageous voices that inspire through the integrity of their lives. Contemporary leadership theorists have sought to define this inner quality that is the bedrock of values-based leadership, refusing to describe it as an amoral activity. Our purpose is to create a bridge between the ability to lead others and moral character. Using an interdisciplinary approach to understand leadership, we will explore the lives, values, and philosophies of eight leaders, examining both successes and failures.

Throughout the last decades, the growing significance of religion and ethnicity in politics is part of a larger
phenomenon often dubbed as the rise of identity politics. But what is the true nature of identity-driven politics
with regard to religion and ethnicity? Are ages-old atavistic conflicts resurfacing after being suppressed by the
modern state and the ideals of enlightenment? Or are these identities simply instrumental tools exploited by
populist politicians at a time when democratic and mass-based politics have become the main norm? And from a
normative and practical point of view, how can and how should a state manage religious and ethnic differences?
Under what conditions do these differences turn into political conflicts? When and why do these conflicts end up
with violence in some settings, whereas in others they are resolved non-violently? This course aims to provide the

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

was similar everywhere, and that civilisations advanced according to universal material and environmental laws.
From the late 18th century through to the first half of the 20th century, this universalist model was challenged by
a growing belief in human difference - and human inequality. Throughout the 19th century, materialist
explanations of human progress based on universal developmental laws would gradually give way to theories of
human order and progress based upon racial hierarchy as the determining factor in historical development. Racial
doctrines which justified slavery and imperialism also increasingly provided nineteenth century anthropologists,
archaeologists and historians with the explanation for the rise of civilisation itself.
But throughout the 19th century, such inequitable visions of progress were challenged by the continuity of the
Enlightenment tradition in the form of theories of technologically-driven progress (the Danish Three Age system),
universal stages of material and mental development (Darwin, Tylor, Lubbock and Morgan) or economic
development and class struggle (Marx, Engels, Childe and their followers).
The course centres upon the tension between theories of progress and those of degeneration. Between conceptions
of the human past envisaged as a primaeval Arcadia of “Noble Savages,” and one characterised by poverty,
ignorance and “nasty, brutish and short” lives. Between the rise of civilisation understood as a universal process
of progression through universal stages of social, religious and economic development on one hand, and theories
which saw civilisation as arising in one place and being spread to other areas – diffusionism – often through the
presumed activity of “superior” racial elements.
The seminar will be based upon the interpretation of original documents. It is intended as a course in intellectual,
rather than social and political, history. The seminar will concentrate on British and North American anthropology,
although the work of some relevant German (F. Max Muller, Baron Christian Carl Josias Bunsen and Rudolf
Virchow), Danish (Thomsen and Worsaae) and French thinkers (Renan and Gobineau) will also feature. (No
knowledge of these languages is necessary or assumed, however.)","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Comprehend and have a clear understanding of the eclipse (and revival) of Enlightenment universalist theories of human progress in the 18th century, and the rise of racial determinist theories from the late 18th through the 19th centuries;</li><li>Understand and analyse the principal original documents pertaining to the great controversies relating to the origins of civilization of the late 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries in the Anglo-Saxon world especially;</li><li>Place in context and lend perspective to racist ideas in terms of their intimate relationship to systems of dominance associated with slavery, imperialism and exclusionary nationalism;</li><li>Understand something of the historical, intellectual and social context which led to the transition from universalist and idealist theories of human anthropology and civilizational progress and their replacement with doctrines founded on the principles of racial difference and inequality. In particular, students should gain some understanding of the intimate relations between racial anti-Semitism and racial theories denigrating the capacities of Africans and colonial subjects;</li><li>Understand the connections between racial theory, imperialism, slavery and social elitism and overall theories of progress and civilization in 19th century British, French and American thought.</li></ul>","HIS389","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

the manner in which religious, cultural, linguistic and physical/biological forms of exclusion have overlapped and
reinforced each other. It is one of the principal contentions of this course that National Socialism’s exterminatory
anti-Semitism is not merely a product of centuries of anti-Jewish prejudice; rather, racial anti-Semitism must be
understood as something which evolved in close symbiosis with racial prejudices directed against Africans – slave

controversies in British historiography: the twin assault on the “Whig” conception of history launched by Herbert
Butterfield and Lewis Namier, and the questions of free will and determinism in history arising from Isaiah Berlin’s
critique of E. H. Carr, and the further controversy over the purpose and utility of historical study between Carr and
Geoffrey Elton. Session 4 looks at the more recent dispute occasioned by Richard Evans’ moderate defence of
empirical history against the challenge of postmodernism.
Session 5 and 6 examine two key rival schools of social history: the French Annales scholars and the
(predominantly British) school of Marxist historiography. Session 7 looks at A. J. P. Taylor and the controversy
surrounding his 1962 revisionist tract The Origins of the Second World War. Taylor’s importance lies in his
dominance within British historical scene in the mid-to-late 20th century, despite his eschewal of any form of
theorising. Taylor is a reminder of the enduring relevance – and relative imperviousness to theory - of diplomatic
history.
Just before the midterm break, Session 8 explores the concept of collective memory in relationship to the memory
of the Jewish Holocaust. Session 9 examines cultural history, through the work of the pioneering historian of
culture Jan Huizinga, author of The Autumn of the Middle Ages, and through the later work of George L. Mosse.
Mosse made major contributions to the study of fascism, interpreting fascism – against prevailing historical and
political science orthodoxies – as essentially a cultural revolution against the liberal bourgeois order.
Sessions 10 through to 14 return to a number of the key methodological challenges of post-colonialism,
ethnological history, Kuhnian approaches to the history of science and postmodernism, focusing on the work of a
number of key thinkers: Edward Said; Keith Thomas; Thomas Kuhn, Michael Ruse and Michel Foucault, along
with the work of their manifold acolytes and critics. Specific topics examined will be the Orientalism; the new
perspectives brought by feminism and cultural anthropology to the interpretation of the Early Modern “witch
craze”; the mid-19th century Darwinian Revolution as a scientific “paradigm shift,” and the impact of Foucault’s
Discipline and Punish on the study of institutions and of Stalinism.

So far Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s admiring rival, has been right. That is partly why reading Shakespeare is so challenging and rewarding. How shall we understand his love sonnets, for example? By our understandings of “love”, or by his? How did he – or his culture, many contemporary critics would say instead – understand “love”? Or history, or gender, or nationhood, or religion, or our very concepts of the self and the universe? How do we accomplish an understanding of Shakespeare’s writing within the context of his culture? Is that even possible, or worth trying to do? Are there other ways to read Shakespeare, and what were and are they? If nothing else, we ought to start with a little humility, given all those questions.
We&#39;ll start by closely reading select poems and plays from the 1950s, the climactic decade of the Elizabethan era. Then we&#39;ll closely read select tragedies and one romance from the early 17th century, the dawn of the Jacobean era. We&#39;ll pay attention not only to the socio-historic context but also to the long history of Shakespeare criticism.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Closely read select poems and plays from the 1590s, in other words during the climactic years of Elizabethan England;</li><li>Closely read some of the tragedies and one of the romances, written at the dawn of the subsequent Jacobean era;</li><li>Understand the main threads of Shakespeare criticism, including modernist and postmodern/postcolonial approaches;</li><li>Understand the socio-historic context of the works.</li></ul>","LIT320","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

was similar everywhere, and that civilisations advanced according to universal material and environmental laws.
From the late 18th century through to the first half of the 20th century, this universalist model was challenged by
a growing belief in human difference - and human inequality. Throughout the 19th century, materialist
explanations of human progress based on universal developmental laws would gradually give way to theories of
human order and progress based upon racial hierarchy as the determining factor in historical development. Racial
doctrines which justified slavery and imperialism also increasingly provided nineteenth century anthropologists,
archaeologists and historians with the explanation for the rise of civilisation itself.
But throughout the 19th century, such inequitable visions of progress were challenged by the continuity of the
Enlightenment tradition in the form of theories of technologically-driven progress (the Danish Three Age system),
universal stages of material and mental development (Darwin, Tylor, Lubbock and Morgan) or economic
development and class struggle (Marx, Engels, Childe and their followers).
The course centres upon the tension between theories of progress and those of degeneration. Between conceptions
of the human past envisaged as a primaeval Arcadia of “Noble Savages,” and one characterised by poverty,
ignorance and “nasty, brutish and short” lives. Between the rise of civilisation understood as a universal process
of progression through universal stages of social, religious and economic development on one hand, and theories
which saw civilisation as arising in one place and being spread to other areas – diffusionism – often through the
presumed activity of “superior” racial elements.
The seminar will be based upon the interpretation of original documents. It is intended as a course in intellectual,
rather than social and political, history. The seminar will concentrate on British and North American anthropology,

So far Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s admiring rival, has been right. That is partly why reading Shakespeare is so challenging and rewarding. How shall we understand his love sonnets, for example? By our understandings of “love”, or by his? How did he – or his culture, many contemporary critics would say instead – understand “love”? Or history, or gender, or nationhood, or religion, or our very concepts of the self and the universe? How do we accomplish an understanding of Shakespeare’s writing within the context of his culture? Is that even possible, or worth trying to do? Are there other ways to read Shakespeare, and what were and are they? If nothing else, we ought to start with a little humility, given all those questions.
We&#39;ll start by closely reading select poems and plays from the 1950s, the climactic decade of the Elizabethan era. Then we&#39;ll closely read select tragedies and one romance from the early 17th century, the dawn of the Jacobean era. We&#39;ll pay attention not only to the socio-historic context but also to the long history of Shakespeare criticism.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Closely read select poems and plays from the 1590s, in other words during the climactic years of Elizabethan England;</li><li>Closely read some of the tragedies and one of the romances, written at the dawn of the subsequent Jacobean era;</li><li>Understand the main threads of Shakespeare criticism, including modernist and postmodern/postcolonial approaches;</li><li>Understand the socio-historic context of the works.</li></ul>","LIT520","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

decisions about how to use our time, what to prioritize, what to do about interpersonal conflicts, and where to go
for lunch. We also make decisions with farther-reaching consequences like our next career move, who we want to
date, and about the lifestyle we want to pursue. Social scientists study how people make these kinds of decisions
and which processes produce the best results, the most happiness, and greatest good. There is much to be gained
by examining and applying the science and ancient wisdom of decision-making in our own lives.
This course is an exploration of making every day and long-term decisions through the lens of social science. We
will examine why people make the decisions they do and practical, research-based ways to make better decisions
personally and professionally. Topics will include cognitive biases in decision making, moral psychology of
choice, creative problem-solving, insights from behavioral economics, the role of values/spirituality, leadership
ethics, and group decision-making. The overall goals will be both to understand the dynamics involved in making
decisions and to construct a framework by which students can make good decisions that can lead to theirs and

focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial

languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the

managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and effective policy making. By studying the psychological processes
underlying cooperation we gain knowledge that can help us create environments and institutions which will be
more successful in tackling the societal challenges. The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the
psychological processes of human cooperation. This course draws on theories and empirical findings from social,
cognitive and developmental psychology, and behavioural economics.
The course will address questions such as:
What are the evolutionary roots of human cooperation?
How does prosocial behavior develop in children?
What are the major strengths and weaknesses of human cooperation?
Which factor supports inter- and intra-group cooperation?
What is the role of communication in cooperative behaviors?
How can our knowledge about game theory models improve decisions in public policy?
The course consists of three main sections.
Section 1 will explore the origins of human cooperation. It will introduce the basic evolutionary mechanisms (such
as direct reciprocity, reputation, punishment etc.) and psychological mechanisms from a developmental and
comparative perspective.
Section 2 will address psychological mechanisms of cooperation such as attention sharing, knowledge sharing and
perspective taking. Both positive and negative motivational forces beyond cooperative behaviours will be
discussed.
Section 3 will address challenges to cooperation, including cheating and exploitation. It will provide a brief
introduction to game theory and will introduce the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as
equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. Students will learn about strategies in games by actually playing and
making decisions in various games. Additionally, Section 3 will demonstrate how some of the present challenges
– overuse of freshwater, depletion of natural resources and managing the COVID-19 pandemic – can be analysed
through game theory approach. We will discuss practical applications.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate understanding of basic terminology, concepts and principles of human cooperation;</li><li>Recognize that human cooperation has multiple layers;</li><li>Understand how scientists accumulate scientific knowledge about human cooperation through discovery, confirmation, and correction;</li><li>Understand how psychology is applied to improving various areas including prosocial behavior and inter- and intra-group cooperation;</li><li>Use Google Scholar to identify the relevant scientific articles for their questions about human cooperation;</li><li>Evaluate how valuable the source and its contents are for answering questions about human cooperation;</li><li>Communicate and collaborate with their classmates.</li></ul>","PSY325","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg000000039gKAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

will be the Greek form of democracy and its contemporary critique, which includes Plato&#39;s diagnosis of those who
wished to win the admiration and love of &quot;the people&quot;. Using various texts, we will strive to define not only the
term “demos” but also “demagogues”. Then, we will move on to the important shifts that took place during the
Roman period, especially in the waning days of the Roman Republic, when the influence of elected politicians
started to increase. We will find out who, according to Cicero and other writers, were populares and optimates and
whether populares were the precursors of modern populists. This particular question, along with more general
discussions of the importance of personal charisma in the history of populism, will allow us to draw connections
with the scholarship on contemporary populism. In this context, we will also consider the difference between
ideological populism and populism without ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Summarize and analyze the arguments presented by philosophers on populism throughout history;</li><li>Comprehend and critically discuss the nature of ancient, medieval and modern concepts of populism;</li><li>Conduct basic academic research and analytical writing appropriate to the undergraduate level;</li><li>Communicate with improved analytical, argumentative, and writing skills;</li><li>Apply knowledge and critical thinking and theoretical insights to contemporary issues.</li></ul>","PHI405","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

Revolution in 1989, as Czechoslovakia’s first post-communist president, and prior to this a leading political
dissident and avant-garde playwright. Students will first discuss Havel’s involvement in the theatre On the
Balustrade in the 1960s. His early absurdist plays will be viewed also in association with the work of prominent
European playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, whose work Havel helped to introduce in Czechoslovakia, and
Tom Stoppard, who has acknowledged a debt to Havel’s drama. The course will move to outline Havel’s
involvement as a dissident after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact, and follow his removal
from the public sphere by the totalitarian regime. Havel’s work as a political dissident will be traced through the
reading of selected essays and petitions, including his letter to President Husák and the Charter 77 declaration. The
latter will be read in its broader context of the coming together of various strands of political dissent (from
opposition intellectuals through ex-communist politicians to the Czech underground movement) due to the
persecution of the rock band The Plastic People of the Universe. Finally, Havel’s official career as a politician will
be outlined, from his role as a founding member of the Civic Forum in 1989, through two terms in office as
President, up to his retirement from top politics and return to creative writing, as exemplified by his last play
Leaving and his subsequent film version of the same. Throughout, Havel’s career will be viewed on the backdrop
of life in Czechoslovakia, through the mild thaw of the 60s, a return to totalitarianism in the 70s and 80s, up to the
liberal atmosphere of the Velvet Revolution, with the objective to facilitate a better understanding of everyday life
in these various periods. Finally, students will have a chance to discuss a recent (2020) biographical film about
Havel, considering how it conceptualises Havel’s importance and legacy. The course will be complemented by
screenings of plentiful documentary material (and, if possible, the physical presentation of a variety of printed and
other materials and artifacts).","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Comprehend and have a clear understanding of Václav Havel’s work as a playwright in the broader context of European theatre, and as a political activist and politician;</li><li>Comprehend the importance of the production context of drama for the creation of meaning, as instantiated by the interpretation of the theatre of the absurd on either side of the Iron Curtain;</li><li>Understand the position of Václav Havel’s thought in the context of twentieth-century politics and philosophy;</li><li>Understand the nature of everyday life in the totalitarian regime of communist Czechoslovakia;</li><li>Comprehend the nature of political dissent in Czechoslovakia, including the role of anti-communist intellectuals, pre-1968 reform communists, and radical rock musicians;</li><li>Identify clearly how Czech politics has changed since Havel’s time as President;</li><li>Understand how Havel’s legacy is perceived in the contemporary Czech Republic.</li></ul>","LIT406","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and effective policy making. By studying the psychological processes
underlying cooperation we gain knowledge that can help us create environments and institutions which will be
more successful in tackling the societal challenges. The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the
psychological processes of human cooperation. This course draws on theories and empirical findings from social,
cognitive and developmental psychology, and behavioural economics.
The course will address questions such as:
What are the evolutionary roots of human cooperation?
How does prosocial behavior develop in children?
What are the major strengths and weaknesses of human cooperation?
Which factor supports inter- and intra-group cooperation?
What is the role of communication in cooperative behaviors?
How can our knowledge about game theory models improve decisions in public policy?
The course consists of three main sections.
Section 1 will explore the origins of human cooperation. It will introduce the basic evolutionary mechanisms (such
as direct reciprocity, reputation, punishment etc.) and psychological mechanisms from a developmental and
comparative perspective.
Section 2 will address psychological mechanisms of cooperation such as attention sharing, knowledge sharing and
perspective taking. Both positive and negative motivational forces beyond cooperative behaviours will be
discussed.
Section 3 will address challenges to cooperation, including cheating and exploitation. It will provide a brief
introduction to game theory and will introduce the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as
equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. Students will learn about strategies in games by actually playing and
making decisions in various games. Additionally, Section 3 will demonstrate how some of the present challenges
– overuse of freshwater, depletion of natural resources and managing the COVID-19 pandemic – can be analysed
through game theory approach.

overall aim of addressing the relevance of literature for our knowledge of the world. Discussing each text in its
historical and social context, it focuses particularly on the ways in which creative writing may be viewed as a form
of intervention in society and politics. However, a non-negligible objective of the course is also to demonstrate
that literature has always been an art form associated with pleasure, and that this is not mutually exclusive with
social or political significance, as technocrats might like to maintain.
The theoretical framing of the course is provided by a typology of critical approaches based on the relative
importance attributed to the author, reader, reality, and text respectively. The course follows the basic Aristotelian
genre categories of fiction, poetry, and drama, paying detailed attention to the creation of meaning within specific
literary forms and their traditions. The sessions focused on fiction include basic training in narratological analysis,
foregrounding the importance of narrative voice, point of view, and plot structure. The sessions dedicated to poetry
involve the basics of poetics, analyzing the use of form and figurative language in the creation of meaning. Finally,
the sessions focused on drama examine the importance of production contexts and styles, and zoom in on the
positioning and engagement of audiences by playwrights and theatre makers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Critically engage with the creation of meaning in complex literary texts;</li><li>Approach literature in the full complexity of a socio-historical context;</li><li>Research literature within a number of different interpretative frameworks;</li><li>Consider literature in its variegated relationship to politics;</li><li>Appreciate the relevance of literature to contemporary reality;</li><li>Communicate their interpretations of literature to peers in discussions and oral presentations, and to a wider audience in essays.</li></ul>","LIT400","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000003AeKAI","[LearningCourse]","Twentieth Century Historiography","The course begins by examining broad trends in 20th century historiography. Sessions 2 and 3 look at two classic
controversies in British historiography: the twin assault on the “Whig” conception of history launched by Herbert
Butterfield and Lewis Namier, and the questions of free will and determinism in history arising from Isaiah Berlin’s
critique of E. H. Carr, and the further controversy over the purpose and utility of historical study between Carr and
Geoffrey Elton. Session 4 looks at the more recent dispute occasioned by Richard Evans’ moderate defence of
empirical history against the challenge of postmodernism.
Session 5 and 6 examine two key rival schools of social history: the French Annales scholars and the
(predominantly British) school of Marxist historiography. Session 7 looks at A. J. P. Taylor and the controversy
surrounding his 1962 revisionist tract The Origins of the Second World War. Taylor’s importance lies in his
dominance within British historical scene in the mid-to-late 20th century, despite his eschewal of any form of
theorising. Taylor is a reminder of the enduring relevance – and relative imperviousness to theory - of diplomatic
history.
Just before the midterm break, Session 8 explores the concept of collective memory in relationship to the memory
of the Jewish Holocaust. Session 9 examines cultural history, through the work of the pioneering historian of
culture Jan Huizinga, author of The Autumn of the Middle Ages, and through the later work of George L. Mosse.
Mosse made major contributions to the study of fascism, interpreting fascism – against prevailing historical and
political science orthodoxies – as essentially a cultural revolution against the liberal bourgeois order.
Sessions 10 through to 14 return to a number of the key methodological challenges of post-colonialism,
ethnological history, Kuhnian approaches to the history of science and postmodernism, focusing on the work of a
number of key thinkers: Edward Said; Keith Thomas; Thomas Kuhn, Michael Ruse and Michel Foucault, along
with the work of their manifold acolytes and critics. Specific topics examined will be the Orientalism; the new
perspectives brought by feminism and cultural anthropology to the interpretation of the Early Modern “witch
craze”; the mid-19th century Darwinian Revolution as a scientific “paradigm shift,” and the impact of Foucault’s
Discipline and Punish on the study of institutions and of Stalinism.
The final session will involve book reports on several the most famous examples of 20th century “microhistories”:
The Return of Martin Guerre; The Cheese and the Worms; Montaillou and The Great Cat Massacre.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Be familiar with four of the most important methodological debates in British historiography in the 20th century the debate inspired by Herbert Butterfield&#39;s Whig Interpretation of History; the famous Carr-Elton-Berlin controversy of the 1960s; the arguments over Richard J.

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000003C3KAI","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

Relations Research Methods courses by connecting theory with empirical reality through practical cases; the
course also serves as an testing “laboratory” for students to see “how it’s done,” how does theory connect to reality,
before they attempt to do it themselves in their own Theses.
Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical
thinking. Research studies on world wars, terrorism, international norms and institutions, women or media political
communication will be the proverbial bread and butter of this course as they best illustrate the application of
theories in particular situations/cases; the goal is to help students understand the logic, structure and process “how
to” get from theoretical assumptions to real-life situation application and results.
Besides supporting the theory-method “backbone” of the International Relations study programme (a string of
prerequisites: 1. Introduction to International Relations 2. International Relations Research Methods 3. Thesis
Seminar 4. Thesis), this course seeks to address older but especially currently discussed topics in the field of
International Relations, foreign policy, security or other interdisciplinary topics. Since this course is intended as

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at

Abstract compositions are everywhere, literally. You can just have a look around you, or go deeper to the images
of micro or macro cosmos. Abstraction can be an illustration of something real, or a process, principle or analysis.
It can also be just pure joy of creating, free of any contact to reality. There are many different techniques you can
use, many forms of which can appear - painting, drawing, collage, video, installation….

from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,

the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg000000042VKAQ","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

media, open source content, blogging and podcasts, fake news, and the impact of algorithms on the polarization

for a democratic nation in the world. But does that guarantee mean you can say or write anything? And if not, why
not? The simple answer is that it wouldn’t be ethical, and has potential for negative consequences. Ethics are not
unique to media. They’re taught in almost every profession, even in nearly every “democratic” country. But
nowhere are they more important than in journalism. And at no time are they more important than now. The market
economy, the pressure by those in power, business interests and digital technology all challenge media ethics.
Media ethics are not limited to political news. Ethics play crucial role in advertising and public relations as well.
Misleading in marketing and communication also can have terrible consequences. Digital technology and social
media introduce new challenges in media, marketing and communication. Today, videos have more influence than
text and, therefore, this course will address media ethics in video production as well. Pseudo-news outlets and bots
spread harmful misinformation repeatedly shared on Facebook and other social media. They confuse the audience
and help in creating a “post-truth” society. In such environments, the media outlets have been struggling to

of intervention in society and politics. However, a non-negligible objective of the course is also to demonstrate
that literature has always been an art form associated with pleasure, and that this is not mutually exclusive with
social or political significance, as technocrats might like to maintain.
The theoretical framing of the course is provided by a typology of critical approaches based on the relative
importance attributed to the author, reader, reality, and text respectively. The course follows the basic Aristotelian
genre categories of fiction, poetry, and drama, paying detailed attention to the creation of meaning within specific
literary forms and their traditions. The sessions focused on fiction include basic training in narratological analysis,
foregrounding the importance of narrative voice, point of view, and plot structure. The sessions dedicated to poetry
involve the basics of poetics, analyzing the use of form and figurative language in the creation of meaning. Finally,

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

human subject away. An alternative set of theories present the entire social reality as a ‘text’, whereas rival formal
theories discard the idea of meaning, language and reflexivity. Additionally, students will acquire competences in

countries. Nobody asks anymore whether Culture, Values, Identity, and Religion do matter in (World) politics
today. This course helps to answer more specific questions instead: Why and how topics like migration and
integration, identity politics and gender, bioethics, faith, and religious symbols, borders, and state sovereignty
became new key political cleavages - and why now? Not only are these issues powerful enough to decide elections,
shape prospects of liberal democracy, as well as international affairs incl. European integration and the relations
between the West and „the Rest“. They have been even tearing apart family members, long-life friends and local
communities. Why the Western societies increasingly fail to agree on basic common principles and even on
essential facts? What causes the polarization, atomization and even radicalization? Has it been mainly the digital
revolution, advanced dissinformation/manipulation campaigns and the psychological mechanisms of vitual
communication? Are there real new threats and insecurities on the rise? Is then ´political correctness´ or rather the
populist politicians, rise of nationalism and emotional politics to be blamed?
In this course, we will investigate together what are the preconditions and consequences of these trends. Also,
possible solutions will be discussed as well as individual topics of ´culture wars´ documented by abundant cases
from various Western countries. While the main focus is put on political and international aspects, the socio-
cultural, psychological, and technological context must be taken seriously as well in this interdisciplinary endeavor

photography, architecture, design, etc.) in the Central Europe from the end of the 18th century until the present,
focusing mainly on the Czech lands (that were part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy until 1918). In the 19th
century Bohemian culture was influenced by nationalist movement i.e. the National Revival, which was inspired
by wider socio-political tendencies at this time. Relations to Austrian and German art were very important during
that time. Since the 19th century we can see a profound shift to French literature (Symbolism, Decadence, Cubism,
etc.). These connections endured until the period between the World War I and World War II (Surrealism, Abstract
art). The period after the Second World War (until 1989) was characterized by a totalitarian political system that
negatively deformed the standard art scene. Czech art acquired new dimension after the political changes of 1989.

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000004l0KAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

was similar everywhere, and that civilisations advanced according to universal material and environmental laws.
From the late 18th century through to the first half of the 20th century, this universalist model was challenged by
a growing belief in human difference - and human inequality. Throughout the 19th century, materialist
explanations of human progress based on universal developmental laws would gradually give way to theories of
human order and progress based upon racial hierarchy as the determining factor in historical development. Racial
doctrines which justified slavery and imperialism also increasingly provided nineteenth century anthropologists,
archaeologists and historians with the explanation for the rise of civilisation itself.
But throughout the 19th century, such inequitable visions of progress were challenged by the continuity of the
Enlightenment tradition in the form of theories of technologically-driven progress (the Danish Three Age system),
universal stages of material and mental development (Darwin, Tylor, Lubbock and Morgan) or economic
development and class struggle (Marx, Engels, Childe and their followers).
The course centres upon the tension between theories of progress and those of degeneration. Between conceptions
of the human past envisaged as a primaeval Arcadia of “Noble Savages,” and one characterised by poverty,
ignorance and “nasty, brutish and short” lives. Between the rise of civilisation understood as a universal process
of progression through universal stages of social, religious and economic development on one hand, and theories
which saw civilisation as arising in one place and being spread to other areas – diffusionism – often through the
presumed activity of “superior” racial elements.

have been addressed through a range of cultural mediums. Specifically, the impact and reception of Communism,
Nazism and Liberal democracy (including anti-totalitarian activism) will be reviewed using a range of cultural
sources. Areas which touch on current tensions between Liberal democracy and illiberalism /authoritarianism will
be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.
In this course we will be mixing approaches to how we explore the issues. Prague is one of the few capitals that
experienced Liberal democracy, Nazism, Communism, and a return to Liberal democracy in little more than 50
years. Therefore, many opportunities emerge to meet people and visit places and events which can increase our

overall aim of addressing the relevance of literature for our knowledge of the world. Discussing each text in its
historical and social context, it focuses particularly on the ways in which creative writing may be viewed as a form
of intervention in society and politics. However, a non-negligible objective of the course is also to demonstrate
that literature has always been an art form associated with pleasure, and that this is not mutually exclusive with
social or political significance, as technocrats might like to maintain.
The theoretical framing of the course is provided by a typology of critical approaches based on the relative
importance attributed to the author, reader, reality, and text respectively. The course follows the basic Aristotelian
genre categories of fiction, poetry, and drama, paying detailed attention to the creation of meaning within specific
literary forms and their traditions. The sessions focused on fiction include basic training in narratological analysis,
foregrounding the importance of narrative voice, point of view, and plot structure. The sessions dedicated to poetry

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000004r7KAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

will investigate how the perception of global governance changed over time, what were the main evolutionary
waves, and what scholars suggest to expect from it in the future. One session will be devoted to the UN, its role
and main criticism. The course will then turn to the so-called global governance architecture.
An appreciation of global life reinforces regional movements and motivates nation-states to form alternative
centers of integration. This power diffusion will be considered, and more criticism of current global order will be
offered.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Have comprehensive knowledge about global world order and role of international institutions in it;</li><li>Have overall knowledge about theoretical explanations of global governance and be able to apply them to case studies;</li><li>Be able to assess claims and evidence about international institutions in a critical manner;</li><li>Be able to engage critically with the literature by exposing and discussing contradictions and problematic issues.</li></ul>","IRS379","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Fall Term"

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000003CZKAY","[LearningCourse]","World History I","This course is primarily an overview of Ancient Civilizations from approximately 3500 BC to AD 1500. It includes
the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous

of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.

the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,

be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.
In this course we will be mixing approaches to how we explore the issues. Prague is one of the few capitals that
experienced Liberal democracy, Nazism, Communism, and a return to Liberal democracy in little more than 50
years. Therefore, many opportunities emerge to meet people and visit places and events which can increase our
understanding of the topic.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Engage critically with a range of relevant films, documentaries, literature, and art;</li><li>Demonstrate a significant understanding of and critical engagement with different aspects of life and resistance in the region during the last century;</li><li>Relate this knowledge to contemporary issues of resurgent authoritarianism, challenges to Liberal democracy and interpretations of the role and relevance of the past;</li><li>Assess and illustrate the origins and experience of totalitarianism, the origins and experience of civil resistance to Nazi and Communist totalitarianism, and the role of artists reflecting it as part of a common discourse and memory.</li></ul>","HSS325","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

sciences: the former, often about confronting timeless questions to do with human thoughts and actions; the latter,
often characterized by a desire to offer valid generalizations on issues of contemporary concern. The first half of
the course looks mainly at social sciences, while the second half attends more to the humanities. Through a
combination of lectures, seminars and group presentations, the course will ultimately provide the student with a
solid foundation upon which to base their later research projects, such as the bachelor’s thesis.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Comprehend and have a clear understanding of various approaches to research in the humanities and social sciences;</li><li>Formulate a robust and satisfying research question;</li><li>Critically understand and compare a variety of research approaches (i.e. paradigms, assumptions, questions of epistemology and ontology);</li><li>Critically understand several widely used research methodologies, including the case study, comparative analysis, grounded theory and content analysis.</li></ul>","SOC290","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at

So far Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s admiring rival, has been right. That is partly why reading Shakespeare is so challenging and rewarding. How shall we understand his love sonnets, for example? By our understandings of “love”, or by his? How did he – or his culture, many contemporary critics would say instead – understand “love”? Or history, or gender, or nationhood, or religion, or our very concepts of the self and the universe? How do we accomplish an understanding of Shakespeare’s writing within the context of his culture? Is that even possible, or worth trying to do? Are there other ways to read Shakespeare, and what were and are they? If nothing else, we ought to start with a little humility, given all those questions.
We&#39;ll start by closely reading select poems and plays from the 1950s, the climactic decade of the Elizabethan era. Then we&#39;ll closely read select tragedies and one romance from the early 17th century, the dawn of the Jacobean era.

attention to the original, indispensable link between populism and democracy. The starting point of our exploration
will be the Greek form of democracy and its contemporary critique, which includes Plato&#39;s diagnosis of those who
wished to win the admiration and love of &quot;the people&quot;. Using various texts, we will strive to define not only the
term “demos” but also “demagogues”. Then, we will move on to the important shifts that took place during the
Roman period, especially in the waning days of the Roman Republic, when the influence of elected politicians
started to increase. We will find out who, according to Cicero and other writers, were populares and optimates and
whether populares were the precursors of modern populists. This particular question, along with more general
discussions of the importance of personal charisma in the history of populism, will allow us to draw connections
with the scholarship on contemporary populism. In this context, we will also consider the difference between
ideological populism and populism without ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Summarize and analyze the arguments presented by philosophers on populism throughout history;</li><li>Comprehend and critically discuss the nature of ancient, medieval and modern concepts of populism;</li><li>Conduct basic academic research and analytical writing appropriate to the undergraduate level;</li><li>Communicate with improved analytical, argumentative, and writing skills;</li><li>Apply knowledge and critical thinking and theoretical insights to contemporary issues.</li></ul>","PHI405","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

Yet few universities explicitly teach the leadership as a relational process that can be learned and put into practice. And professions across the globe suffer from a lack of courageous leadership. In this course, we start with the assumption that leadership can be learned and that one of the best ways to learn it is from examining the lives of ordinary people who were able to accomplish the extraordinary. Through the lens of contemporary leadership research, we draw lessons, strategies, and inspiration for becoming leaders in our own domain and context.
One of the most universal cravings of the human spirit is for leadership that is grounded in character, one that reaches beyond success to significance. Many say that our times are defined by a leadership crisis, a void of courageous voices that inspire through the integrity of their lives. Contemporary leadership theorists have sought to define this inner quality that is the bedrock of values-based leadership, refusing to describe it as an amoral activity. Our purpose is to create a bridge between the ability to lead others and moral character. Using an interdisciplinary approach to understand leadership, we will explore the lives, values, and philosophies of eight leaders, examining both successes and failures. This course seeks to hone students’ analytical capabilities, to foster their understanding of key concepts of the leadership literature, to help them develop a set of systematic ideas regarding moral leadership, and to stimulate their capacity for self-awareness as potential leaders and as informed and responsible followers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe the context of each leader, including the social, political, economic and cultural environment and pressures that shaped the unique situations in which they exercised moral responsibility;</li><li>Compare and contrast leaders related to their contexts, aims, strategies, and outcomes;</li><li>Interpret the lessons of historical leaders through the lens of leadership theory and research;</li><li>Synthesize the lessons through the leaders and readings to constructing a framework for their own leadership;</li><li>Analyze the role of moral character within the activity of leading others;</li><li>Discover their own values, principles and methods through the human stories of these individuals.</li></ul>","SOC355","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

So far Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s admiring rival, has been right. That is partly why reading Shakespeare is so challenging and rewarding. How shall we understand his love sonnets, for example? By our understandings of “love”, or by his? How did he – or his culture, many contemporary critics would say instead – understand “love”? Or history, or gender, or nationhood, or religion, or our very concepts of the self and the universe? How do we accomplish an understanding of Shakespeare’s writing within the context of his culture? Is that even possible, or worth trying to do? Are there other ways to read Shakespeare, and what were and are they? If nothing else, we ought to start with a little humility, given all those questions.
We&#39;ll start by closely reading select poems and plays from the 1950s, the climactic decade of the Elizabethan era. Then we&#39;ll closely read select tragedies and one romance from the early 17th century, the dawn of the Jacobean era. We&#39;ll pay attention not only to the socio-historic context but also to the long history of Shakespeare criticism.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Closely read select poems and plays from the 1590s, in other words during the climactic years of Elizabethan England;</li><li>Closely read some of the tragedies and one of the romances, written at the dawn of the subsequent Jacobean era;</li><li>Understand the main threads of Shakespeare criticism, including modernist and postmodern/postcolonial approaches;</li><li>Understand the socio-historic context of the works.</li></ul>","LIT520","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

Yet few universities explicitly teach the leadership as a relational process that can be learned and put into practice. And professions across the globe suffer from a lack of courageous leadership. In this course, we start with the assumption that leadership can be learned and that one of the best ways to learn it is from examining the lives of ordinary people who were able to accomplish the extraordinary. Through the lens of contemporary leadership research, we draw lessons, strategies, and inspiration for becoming leaders in our own domain and context.
One of the most universal cravings of the human spirit is for leadership that is grounded in character, one that reaches beyond success to significance. Many say that our times are defined by a leadership crisis, a void of courageous voices that inspire through the integrity of their lives. Contemporary leadership theorists have sought to define this inner quality that is the bedrock of values-based leadership, refusing to describe it as an amoral activity. Our purpose is to create a bridge between the ability to lead others and moral character. Using an interdisciplinary approach to understand leadership, we will explore the lives, values, and philosophies of eight leaders, examining both successes and failures. This course seeks to hone students’ analytical capabilities, to foster their understanding of key concepts of the leadership literature, to help them develop a set of systematic ideas regarding moral leadership, and to stimulate their capacity for self-awareness as potential leaders and as informed and responsible followers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe the context of each leader, including the social, political, economic and cultural environment and pressures that shaped the unique situations in which they exercised moral responsibility;</li><li>Compare and contrast leaders related to their contexts, aims, strategies, and outcomes;</li><li>Interpret the lessons of historical leaders through the lens of leadership theory and research;</li><li>Synthesize the lessons through the leaders and readings to constructing a framework for their own leadership;</li><li>Analyze the role of moral character within the activity of leading others;</li><li>Discover their own values, principles and methods through the human stories of these individuals.</li></ul>","SOC555","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg00000006bhKAA","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000KDFKA2","[LearningCourse]","World History I","This course is primarily an overview of Ancient Civilizations from approximately 3500 BC to AD 1500. It includes
the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Spring Term"

the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

for a democratic nation in the world. But does that guarantee mean you can say or write anything? And if not, why
not? The simple answer is that it wouldn’t be ethical, and has potential for negative consequences. Ethics are not
unique to media. They’re taught in almost every profession, even in nearly every “democratic” country. But
nowhere are they more important than in journalism. And at no time are they more important than now. The market
economy, the pressure by those in power, business interests and digital technology all challenge media ethics.
Media ethics are not limited to political news. Ethics play crucial role in advertising and public relations as well.
Misleading in marketing and communication also can have terrible consequences. Digital technology and social
media introduce new challenges in media, marketing and communication. Today, videos have more influence than
text and, therefore, this course will address media ethics in video production as well. Pseudo-news outlets and bots
spread harmful misinformation repeatedly shared on Facebook and other social media. They confuse the audience
and help in creating a “post-truth” society. In such environments, the media outlets have been struggling to
maintain ethics in journalism, making compromises for the sake of profit, interest or politics. The course will

relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

include perspectives which seek to understand human action from ‘the inside’, by paying attention to its subjective
or intersubjective meaning, as well as rival, scientific perspectives of studying the social world which assume the
human subject away. An alternative set of theories present the entire social reality as a ‘text’, whereas rival formal
theories discard the idea of meaning, language and reflexivity. Additionally, students will acquire competences in
research design with a particular emphasis on qualitative research (ethnography, participant observation, case
studies). The aim is to enable each researcher to develop an independent research project by identifying a
methodological tradition of choice and by acquiring basic knowledge of its fundamental principles, as an

focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

the civilizations of the Ancient Near East, Ancient and Medieval India, Ancient and Medieval China, the Ancient
Greek and Roman civilizations, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Eurasian world in the Middle Ages, and
finally, a brief overview of Native American Civilizations from their earliest appearance to the arrival of Columbus
in 1492. This “World History” course is conceived as an opportunity to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored the history of other regions.
Thus, the emphasis is on “non-western” civilization, although “western” civilization (of course a part of “world
history) is not ignored.
This course focuses more on comparison of civilizations than contrast. While differences between human
civilizations are striking and important, the amount of similarity, and the ability of all humans to adapt to, learn
from, and modify new cultures is also significant. Therefore, the class tries to focus on universal themes, such as
the development of writing, the spread of “universal” languages, political ideals of global significance, imperial
systems and their management, philosophies and ideologies, and the development of major religious systems and
the unifying cultures they helped to create.
The class critically analyses the notion a historical “clash” between mutually antagonistic civilizations. The course
looks at ways in which humans have sought to organize and unify themselves. It searches more for similarities and
integration than for sensational “exoticism” and remote otherness (although there is much that is intriguing and
surprising!). Rather than presuming perpetual antagonism and a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme,
the course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Understand the specific contexts for crucial developments in human culture, such as the invention of writing, the development of political ideals, the creation of systems of governance, and the main religious systems that are still significant parts of human culture;</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race,” and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS103","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

have been addressed through a range of cultural mediums. Specifically, the impact and reception of Communism,
Nazism and Liberal democracy (including anti-totalitarian activism) will be reviewed using a range of cultural
sources. Areas which touch on current tensions between Liberal democracy and illiberalism /authoritarianism will
be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.

managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and effective policy making. By studying the psychological processes
underlying cooperation we gain knowledge that can help us create environments and institutions which will be
more successful in tackling the societal challenges. The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the
psychological processes of human cooperation. This course draws on theories and empirical findings from social,
cognitive and developmental psychology, and behavioural economics.
The course will address questions such as:
What are the evolutionary roots of human cooperation?
How does prosocial behavior develop in children?
What are the major strengths and weaknesses of human cooperation?
Which factor supports inter- and intra-group cooperation?
What is the role of communication in cooperative behaviors?
How can our knowledge about game theory models improve decisions in public policy?
The course consists of three main sections.
Section 1 will explore the origins of human cooperation. It will introduce the basic evolutionary mechanisms (such
as direct reciprocity, reputation, punishment etc.) and psychological mechanisms from a developmental and
comparative perspective.
Section 2 will address psychological mechanisms of cooperation such as attention sharing, knowledge sharing and
perspective taking. Both positive and negative motivational forces beyond cooperative behaviours will be
discussed.
Section 3 will address challenges to cooperation, including cheating and exploitation. It will provide a brief
introduction to game theory and will introduce the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as
equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. Students will learn about strategies in games by actually playing and
making decisions in various games. Additionally, Section 3 will demonstrate how some of the present challenges

for a democratic nation in the world. But does that guarantee mean you can say or write anything? And if not, why
not? The simple answer is that it wouldn’t be ethical, and has potential for negative consequences. Ethics are not
unique to media. They’re taught in almost every profession, even in nearly every “democratic” country. But
nowhere are they more important than in journalism. And at no time are they more important than now. The market
economy, the pressure by those in power, business interests and digital technology all challenge media ethics.
Media ethics are not limited to political news. Ethics play crucial role in advertising and public relations as well.
Misleading in marketing and communication also can have terrible consequences. Digital technology and social
media introduce new challenges in media, marketing and communication. Today, videos have more influence than
text and, therefore, this course will address media ethics in video production as well. Pseudo-news outlets and bots
spread harmful misinformation repeatedly shared on Facebook and other social media. They confuse the audience
and help in creating a “post-truth” society. In such environments, the media outlets have been struggling to

photography, architecture, design, etc.) in the Central Europe from the end of the 18th century until the present,
focusing mainly on the Czech lands (that were part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy until 1918). In the 19th
century Bohemian culture was influenced by nationalist movement i.e. the National Revival, which was inspired
by wider socio-political tendencies at this time. Relations to Austrian and German art were very important during
that time. Since the 19th century we can see a profound shift to French literature (Symbolism, Decadence, Cubism,
etc.). These connections endured until the period between the World War I and World War II (Surrealism, Abstract
art). The period after the Second World War (until 1989) was characterized by a totalitarian political system that
negatively deformed the standard art scene. Czech art acquired new dimension after the political changes of 1989.

Throughout the last decades, the growing significance of religion and ethnicity in politics is part of a larger
phenomenon often dubbed as the rise of identity politics. But what is the true nature of identity-driven politics
with regard to religion and ethnicity? Are ages-old atavistic conflicts resurfacing after being suppressed by the
modern state and the ideals of enlightenment? Or are these identities simply instrumental tools exploited by
populist politicians at a time when democratic and mass-based politics have become the main norm? And from a
normative and practical point of view, how can and how should a state manage religious and ethnic differences?
Under what conditions do these differences turn into political conflicts? When and why do these conflicts end up
with violence in some settings, whereas in others they are resolved non-violently? This course aims to provide the
students some analytical tools to find their own answers to such questions and understand the ways religion and

abstract forms with painting as the starting point. In this course we will try out the principles of experimental art
from the 1960&#39;s up until today, examining such categories as dripping, stencil art, lettrism, post-surrealism, op-art,
new geometric abstraction, pointillism, orphism, fauvism and many more. Abstraction in all its forms is going to
play an important role across the various media.
Abstract compositions are everywhere, literally. You can just have a look around you, or go deeper to the images
of micro or macro cosmos. Abstraction can be an illustration of something real, or a process, principle or analysis.
It can also be just pure joy of creating, free of any contact to reality. There are many different techniques you can
use, many forms of which can appear - painting, drawing, collage, video, installation….
Students will be confronted with artistic practice while getting to know the theory of contemporary art, attending
exhibitions, and participating in an end of course collective exhibition. They are given motivation tasks, but mostly
create their own visions. The course is led by established visual artist Jana Babincová and her guest artist Daniel

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000GBFKA2","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

Many recent studies have established the connection between leader self-awareness and relational competencies such as teamwork, goal-performance and communication. We will explore themes such as self-disclosure, trust, power, self-regulation, and emotional intelligence in terms of the relationship to an effective leadership process. Students will use psychological assessments and tools to understand themselves and their leadership strengths and weaknesses.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Explain key psychological concepts related to fostering good leadership;</li><li>Describe the reciprocal relationship between the internal and the external dimensions of leadership;</li><li>Synthesize the relationship between an area of psychological inquiry (e.g. narcissism) in terms of its relationship to the leadership process;</li><li>Analyze their own personality and internal defense mechanisms that come into play when attempting to influence others toward a common pursuit;</li><li>Articulate their own leadership philosophy—including their personal commitments and habits that flow from it.</li></ul>","PSY275","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

Moreover in recent years, many advanced democracies and semi-democratic regimes have retreated since the leading authoritarian regimes like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia bolstered up in the global arena. We live in a historical stage whereby ‘authoritarianism goes global.’ It is time we explore the varieties and inner workings of authoritarian regimes and the way they challenge the democratic regimes today. How do authoritarian regimes persist and consolidate? What are different types of authoritarian regimes? What strategies and toolkits do the autocrats use to sustain their power? What weakens the power of the autocrats? Why is authoritarianism becoming more salient at the global level? This course introduces the most prominent and up-to-date theoretical approaches to authoritarian regimes to shed light on such questions. It utilizes the comparative method in political science and works with a variety of case studies from Asia, Latin America, Africa, Middle East as well as Europe. Its goal is to clarify our understanding and make a theoretically informed assessment of contemporary authoritarianism and its increasing influence within domestic and international domains.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","<p>Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:</p><p>•    Name, describe and classify different types of authoritarian regimes across the world</p><p>•    Understand the key strategies that the autocratic rulers use to sustain an authoritarian regime and empirically identify these strategies</p><p>•    Apply the main theoretical approaches to the survival and spread of authoritarian regimes</p><p>•    Analyze the existing situation (weakness, strength &amp; potential for collapse) in contemporary authoritarian regimes, based on publicly available evidence and knowledge</p><p>•    Comprehend and critique professional writing</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","POS367","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Fall Term"

“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"
"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000Q7NKAU","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that

pamphlets and government propaganda, news media outlets have become, in the last 30 years, a global force of
once unimaginable scale and power. We will review their assumed role as the people’s watchdog and the protector
of the informed citizen, against a backdrop of private interests and rising corporate oligopolies. It is our aim,
therefore, to understand mass media power and how it relates to the idea of maintaining democratic values. We
will continue by looking at the seismic impact the internet has had on information dissemination; namely: social
media, open source content, blogging and podcasts, fake news, and the impact of algorithms on the polarization
of political opinion. With such a plethora of knowledge at our fingertips, are citizens of democracies today more

Britain and the Soviet Union against the threat of Nazi Germany and the Axis powers. We will then trace the
deterioration of this alliance after 1945 into hostile camps, and the intensification of superpower conflict in Asia
during the 1950s. The death of Stalin in 1953 brought with it some hope for a relaxation of these tensions. But by
the end of the 1950s and the early 1960s, the Cold War had entered its most dangerous period, with crises in
Europe and the Caribbean (the successive Berlin and Cuban Missile crises) which very nearly resulted in a nuclear
conflagration.
A period of so-called détente followed in the later 60s and the 1970s. But a relaxation in tensions between the two
superpowers was paradoxically characterised by an intensification of conflict on the periphery of the superpowers’
spheres of influence – in South East, the Middle East and Africa. America’s unending war in Vietnam, and the
war fought between the Arab states and Israel in 1973 – almost brought the world economy to the brink of collapse
in the 1970s.
The Cold War would enter another intense phase – the so-called “Second Cold War” – in the late 1970s and early
1980s, almost resulting in the outbreak of nuclear war in 1983. Yet, just at the point where the conflict seemed at
its most intense and irreconcilable, it suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the coming to power in the Soviet
Union of Mikhail Gorbachev and the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the
Soviet Union itself in 1991.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly as it developed after 1945;</li><li>Understand the main rival schools of thought regarding the causes and development of the Cold War – the &quot;Orthodox School,&quot; the &quot;Revisionists,&quot; the &quot;Post-Revisionists&quot; and the &quot;Post-Soviets&quot;;</li><li>Have gained an understanding of some of the more controversial topics relating to the Cold War period, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb; whether the Soviet;</li><li>Have gained a basic acquaintance with some of the key documentary sources relating to the Cold War;</li><li>Consider the role of great power strategic and economic interests, competing ideologies (capitalism, democracy, imperialism, communism, Pan-Slavism), nationalism, ethnic conflict and anti-colonialism in shaping the Cold War conflict.</li></ul>","IRS251","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

cognate fields such as International Relations, Law, and sociology. Problems of methodology and research design
will be approached in the broader context of the philosophy of social science. Throughout the course students will
have the opportunity to engage a series of debates concerning the core methodological and philosophical traditions
in the social sciences such as positivism, hermeneutics, Marxism, poststructuralism, and formal theory. These
include perspectives which seek to understand human action from ‘the inside’, by paying attention to its subjective
or intersubjective meaning, as well as rival, scientific perspectives of studying the social world which assume the
human subject away. An alternative set of theories present the entire social reality as a ‘text’, whereas rival formal
theories discard the idea of meaning, language and reflexivity. Additionally, students will acquire competences in
research design with a particular emphasis on qualitative research (ethnography, participant observation, case
studies). The aim is to enable each researcher to develop an independent research project by identifying a
methodological tradition of choice and by acquiring basic knowledge of its fundamental principles, as an

Nazism and Liberal democracy (including anti-totalitarian activism) will be reviewed using a range of cultural
sources. Areas which touch on current tensions between Liberal democracy and illiberalism /authoritarianism will
be addressed. The course will involve a core seminar approach. Film, literature, and the arts have always played a
central role in reflecting the attitudes towards the twin ideologies of Nazism and Communism in Central and
Eastern Europe. They were central to propagandizing these ideologies and building their strength after World War
I. However, they also provided the most vibrant forum for those challenging the totalitarian regimes established
by Nazis and Communists. In the period since their fall, film, literature, and the arts have remained the core site
of public debate on their nature, context and lasting impact. This course will explore this theme in a multi-
disciplinary way, drawing on history, political science, literature, film studies, and psychology. There is a broad
and deep amount of material to draw upon which will allow students to easily inquire into areas of particular
interest to them. In order to reinforce the point that the issues we are examining have meaning across regions and
times, we will work thematically rather than chronologically.

Through the lens of contemporary leadership research, we draw lessons, strategies, and inspiration for becoming leaders in our own domain and context.
One of the most universal cravings of the human spirit is for leadership that is grounded in character, one that reaches beyond success to significance. Many say that our times are defined by a leadership crisis, a void of courageous voices that inspire through the integrity of their lives. Contemporary leadership theorists have sought to define this inner quality that is the bedrock of values-based leadership, refusing to describe it as an amoral activity.

Using an interdisciplinary approach to understand leadership, we will explore the lives, values, and philosophies of eight leaders, examining both successes and failures.

Through the lens of contemporary leadership research, we draw lessons, strategies, and inspiration for becoming leaders in our own domain and context.
One of the most universal cravings of the human spirit is for leadership that is grounded in character, one that reaches beyond success to significance. Many say that our times are defined by a leadership crisis, a void of courageous voices that inspire through the integrity of their lives. Contemporary leadership theorists have sought to define this inner quality that is the bedrock of values-based leadership, refusing to describe it as an amoral activity. Our purpose is to create a bridge between the ability to lead others and moral character. Using an interdisciplinary approach to understand leadership, we will explore the lives, values, and philosophies of eight leaders, examining both successes and failures. This course seeks to hone students’ analytical capabilities, to foster their understanding of key concepts of the leadership literature, to help them develop a set of systematic ideas regarding moral leadership, and to stimulate their capacity for self-awareness as potential leaders and as informed and responsible followers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe the context of each leader, including the social, political, economic and cultural environment and pressures that shaped the unique situations in which they exercised moral responsibility;</li><li>Compare and contrast leaders related to their contexts, aims, strategies, and outcomes;</li><li>Interpret the lessons of historical leaders through the lens of leadership theory and research;</li><li>Synthesize the lessons through the leaders and readings to constructing a framework for their own leadership;</li><li>Analyze the role of moral character within the activity of leading others;</li><li>Discover their own values, principles and methods through the human stories of these individuals.</li></ul>","SOC555","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

for a democratic nation in the world. But does that guarantee mean you can say or write anything? And if not, why
not? The simple answer is that it wouldn’t be ethical, and has potential for negative consequences. Ethics are not
unique to media. They’re taught in almost every profession, even in nearly every “democratic” country. But
nowhere are they more important than in journalism. And at no time are they more important than now. The market
economy, the pressure by those in power, business interests and digital technology all challenge media ethics.
Media ethics are not limited to political news. Ethics play crucial role in advertising and public relations as well.
Misleading in marketing and communication also can have terrible consequences. Digital technology and social
media introduce new challenges in media, marketing and communication. Today, videos have more influence than
text and, therefore, this course will address media ethics in video production as well. Pseudo-news outlets and bots
spread harmful misinformation repeatedly shared on Facebook and other social media. They confuse the audience
and help in creating a “post-truth” society. In such environments, the media outlets have been struggling to
maintain ethics in journalism, making compromises for the sake of profit, interest or politics. The course will

commercial and geopolitical system based on slavery; the shock of the American Revolution; the opening up of a
‘Second Empire’ in Asia and the southern hemisphere; the British transition from preeminent slave traders to
global abolitionists; the Victorian imperial mission and its consequences; and the Empire’s twilight years in the
era of the two world wars. The course is keenly interested in exploring the historiography of the Empire. It requires
students to read and reflect critically on the key questions and answers generated by historians and the debates
which these contributions have inspired. Having completed the course, the student will have an enriched

technical studio instruction for this expression. After introductory lectures and technical demonstrations, the
students will work directly from live nude models. Here students will be taught the basics of painting from the
figure while simultaneously applying the experiences and knowledge gained from the lectures, readings and
discussions.
The practical lectures will address the fundamental technical issues of creating a painting as well as a more
advanced treatment of composition, chiaroscuro, color, subject matter, and expression.
The theoretical lectures will address the historical and contemporary attitudes and reasons for using the nude figure
as an idea in art. Contemporary issues will include recent attitudes about gender and the significance of the gender
of the artist as well as the gender of the model.
Because painting, and especially from the model, requires a long period of concentrated time, this studio course
will be longer than a typical lecture course. We will begin at 10:00 with a brief lecture or demonstration before
starting to paint. There will be an hour lunch break (12:30 – 13:30) and we will conclude at 16:00.
This is the common structure for most art academy classes as opposed to the typical university lecture courses.

Supreme Courses on civil rights that arose in the last two centuries. The course also places emphasis on the concept
of civic association as originally articulated by Alexis de Tocqueville and then further elaborated upon by scholars
such as Theda Skocpol and Robert Putnam. Students will also be assessed according to their understanding of key
theoretical frameworks that have been used to explain civic association, cultural participation, and declining rates
of social capital in the United States. The second part delves into international human rights, global civil society,
and transnational NGO communities. Democratic Peace theory in International Relations is given attention and
alongside these topics, the US Civil Rights movement is emphasized as are similar movements including pro-
democracy protests that arose in 1968. The course then covers how political interests in the post-WWII were

to equip students with a practical understanding of the law, not just to give them a theoretical knowledge. In other
words, students should learn how a lawyer approaches legal problems, and become sufficiently familiar with the
relevant rules so that they too can advise a hypothetical client of what his rights and liabilities are likely to be in a
particular situation, for example, if he is charged with a crime, or considers that his private rights have been
violated and wishes to sue the perpetrator. Students will become familiar with how law operates in different
jurisdictions, but emphasis will be placed on laws in the US, UK and EU.
The course surveys the principal rules governing civil and criminal actions, examines how courts operate, what
sources of law are available to them, as well as alternative methods for resolving legal disputes. The class will
evaluate and look in detail at typical legal problems and at some common crimes and civil wrongs which citizens
and companies are likely to deal with. A selection of these rules is studied in reasonable depth. In the process, it is
hoped that students will, as well as acquiring an overall knowledge of law, also gain a feel for “how law works in
practice”.
Students will have opportunities to put their knowledge into practice through mock negotiations, contract drafting
and mock mediations. Furthermore, students will be expected to gain a better understand of real legal issues
through evaluation of law in the news. Finally, students will explore advanced legal topics and present their
research and findings through oral presentations and research papers.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of the main concepts of law, in particular the nature of legal rights and the remedies available to plaintiffs when their rights are breached (legal wrongs);</li><li>Describe the structure, personnel (judges, lawyers and parties to the action) and function of courts and the particular rules governing the conduct of legal actions;</li><li>Distinguish clearly between the concepts of public and private law, and between natural persons and legal persons;</li><li>Understand and be able to illustrate how the jurisdiction of courts over places and persons operates;</li><li>Describe the principal legal rules relating to the law of property, contract, tort, and criminal law, and be able to apply them effectively to particular day-to-day problems;</li><li>Describe the principal sources of law and explain (in outline) how these have come into being;</li><li>Make effective use of relevant cases and statutes in support of legal arguments;</li><li>Use appropriate legal terminology and language with reasonable confidence and accuracy.</li></ul>","LEG101","School of Business","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000UCbKAM","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000UanKAE","[LearningCourse]","World History II","This course is primarily an overview of World History from approximately 1500 to 2000. The first few weeks
focus on the pre-industrial world, including the Age of Exploration, the Islamic Empires, Early Modern China and
Japan, and the development of the early American colonies and the Atlantic Slave Trade. A key turning point in
the class is the Industrial Revolution (week 5), which drew a sharp line between industrial and pre-industrial
regions, which often (but not always) corresponded to “western” and “non-western.” The reminder of the course
looks at how individuals in pre-industrial societies quickly adapted to the new, often brutal, but sometimes
liberating situation. This will include topics such as the two world wars, the international appeal of the
“communist” model, and the vexing problems of decolonization.
Modern World History is a vast subject, so instead of discussing every detail, the course emphasizes selected
themes of universal significance. One of the aims of this course is to restore balance to educational systems that
have traditionally emphasized the history of “western civilization” and largely ignored other regions. However,
“the west” is also part of the world, and in the modern era it has been especially influential (through imperialism,
for example). At the time of Christopher Columbus, it is possible to argue that the great world civilizations were
roughly “equal” in economic, intellectual, and political sophistication. So where did notions of “western
superiority” (often expressed in terms of “race”) come from? What made the rapid subjugation of pre-industrial
peoples possible in the nineteenth-century? How did people around the world respond to this rapid political,
economic, and cultural subjugation? Although there was plenty of antagonism in modern World History, this
course emphasizes cultural negotiation, continual change and adaptation, syncretism, and advantageous
borrowing. Rather than presuming a simple “oppression” and “victimization” scheme (although there were a lot
of victims!), this course looks at how rapidly and skilfully people around the world learned the technologies,
languages, and ideologies of a new age, despite horrific and unfair conditions. “Race” proved no barrier to the
creation of a modern, global, industrial culture.
Instead of “exotic” differences (which there sometimes were), this course emphasizes unifying similarities and
shared global cultures. It emphasizes, for example, shared beliefs about religion and magic, the global culture of
the Industrial Revolution, the nearly universal appeal of nationalism, the various versions of “communism” and
its world-wide appeal, and finally, the global appeal of racial ideology.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Develop at least a basic reserve of specific data about World History in order to have an informed and educated conversation about it, and to have a better sense of how to find and use such information when needed;</li><li>Be capable of recognizing, understanding, and critically analysing areas of disagreement and uncertainty in World History, and knowing what some of the major controversies are, not only recognize key areas of dispute about World History, but also understand, at least on a basic level, how historical arguments are made and how historical evidence is evaluated and used;</li><li>Recognize and appreciate the significance of constant change in World History (in religious beliefs, philosophical beliefs, political organisation, political geography, economic surroundings, demographics, and group identity);</li><li>Critically analyse traditional notions of cultural superiority and inferiority, understand their connection to modern ideas such as “race” and industrial development, and develop a broader and global understanding of culture and civilization.</li></ul>","HIS104","School of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences","[AcademicSession]","2025/26 Spring Term"

"[CourseOffering]","0P0Vg0000000GnxKAE","[LearningCourse]","Topics in International Relations","This course builds on the knowledge gained in the Introduction to International Relations and International
Relations Research Methods courses by connecting theory with empirical reality through practical cases; the
course also serves as an testing “laboratory” for students to see “how it’s done,” how does theory connect to reality,
before they attempt to do it themselves in their own Theses.
Throughout the course, a range of diverse topics will be covered – from World Wars, Cold War and its aftermath,
through colonization, to European integration, global governance, rise of international norms or role of women in
politics – all addressed through at least two different theoretical lenses for comparison and development of critical
thinking. Research studies on world wars, terrorism, international norms and institutions, women or media political
communication will be the proverbial bread and butter of this course as they best illustrate the application of
theories in particular situations/cases; the goal is to help students understand the logic, structure and process “how
to” get from theoretical assumptions to real-life situation application and results.
Besides supporting the theory-method “backbone” of the International Relations study programme (a string of
prerequisites: 1. Introduction to International Relations 2. International Relations Research Methods 3. Thesis
Seminar 4. Thesis), this course seeks to address older but especially currently discussed topics in the field of
International Relations, foreign policy, security or other interdisciplinary topics. Since this course is intended as
an advanced IR course – seminar format is the preferred choice with the bulk of work focused on cases (analysed
from particular theoretical perspectives), to demonstrate to students their logic and argumentation, work with data,
operationalization of theoretical concepts etc.","<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Pick an appropriate theory for the problem at hand;</li><li>Weigh pros and cons of particular perspective in case studies;</li><li>Understand the structure of research papers and case studies (be able to identify its sections such as literature review, problem justification, theoretical perspective, identify concepts used, identify their “translation” in the given case);</li><li>Start creating their own research designs – monkey see monkey do.</li></ul>","IRS270","School of International Relations and Diplomacy","[AcademicSession]","2024/25 Summer I Session"
